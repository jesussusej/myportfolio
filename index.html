                        Jesus is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of the topic at hand.
                        He's got a great attitude &  is an excellent team player.
                        He has a curious mind and likes to ask questions.<br>
                        He takes initiative within a team and has potentials to lead the team.

                        Working with Jesus has been a great experience.
                        He has lived in 4 different countries and has friends evewyehere, he is a very interesting person, very knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right.<br>
                        For any future projects that need his expertise I would definitely want to work with him again.

                        I have worked with Jesus in business school, he is a bit of an odd type, he can seem distant at times, but is because hes thinking of ways to solve the issue at hand.<br>
                        He reads a lot and because of that he enjoys a good debate and is a great addition to any team.
                        He's committed to make ends meet and most of the time know what he's talking about.
                        He's definitely a good asset in any team, if not by his knowledge and attitude, he can be a quite a joker from time to time.

                        Jesus is a good friend, and a good team member.
                        He always look out for others and is a good listener, which is great for both instances.<br>
                        Everytime I get a chance of being in a team with him, I know the work will be executed correctly and the work will be enjoyable.

                        <span>&#8220;</span>
                        I don't know how he does it, i guess it's because he know a lot of people and reads alot; but he can talk about anything with anyone.<br>
                        That is one of the reasons I like to call him my friend. 
                        <span>&#8221;</span>

                        Jesus is the kind of person that can picture the extreme cases, which is a great tool as he can make us understand we are not in the worst case and what we are missing to be in the best case.<br>
                        He applies this principle in many things and it seems to help him and the team a lot.
                        He's a good addition to any team for sure.
